      1. <span class="12ptarialbold"><i>Tolerance</i></span>. Go ahead, prune 
      it if you think it&#8217;ll make you feel better. Apply some herbicide, 
      or plant invasive hairy vetch to try and choke this baby out. Cut back the 
      creepers or run over them with a lawn mower. Claw at the roots with your 
      bare hands if you must. <i>Once in, always in!</i> said an 1837 circular 
      found still wheat-pasted to the wall of a long-abandoned seed supply company 
      out near Jacksonville. Will eat your house eventually if your faith is strong 
      enough. <i>Give glory to God in the highest, and peace to His people on 
      earth.</i><br>
      <br>
      2.<i> <span class="12ptarialbold">Forbearance</span></i>. The whole point 
      of this magnificent vine is not the slick Chinese jade-green foliage that 
      dazzles the eye as it is the utter pointlessness of even planting it in 
      the first place. The first spring, enjoy its all-covering opulence! Thereafter, 
      no amount of fertilization, accommodation, improved lighting conditions, 
      or consultation with experts will stop Forbearance from reducing itself 
      by half. And so again the next year, and again the next. <i>Good friend 
      to dig the dust enclosed here</i> and whatnot. Half-remembered rhymes &amp; 
      ill-forgotten vines for these best new grasping times. <i>Selah</i>.<br>
      <br>
      3. <span class="12ptarialbold"><i>Noncompliance</i></span>. Deep down in 
      your heart you know you&#8217;re right. All your friends say you&#8217;re 
      wrong, or they used to until they got tired of telling you so. What do they 
      know? And what about us? Let&#8217;s not get greedy here: there is plenty 
      of blame to spread around. Come friends, come foes, and sup at the bounteous 
      horn of noncompliance. Its flowers burst from its roots: when we accidentally 
      uncover them with a careless bootheel crushing out a cigarette butt, we 
      are stunned. It&#8217;s such a pretty flower! Why has nature preordained 
      that it grow underground, away from the light? <i>Ours not to reason why</i>. 
      You don&#8217;t even want to hear the end of that one, brother. <br>
      <br>
      4.<i> <span class="12ptarialbold">Incandescence</span></i>. Unremarkable 
      when green, except that it hangs all thick and heavy around the things it 
      climbs. Highly combustible when it dries out around the end of October. 
      Matches are free at most bars and you can pocket several books of them before 
      anybody even notices you&#8217;ve come through the door. <i>My house shall 
      be called a house of prayer for all people</i>. Our own personal virtue 
      is that we know we&#8217;ll look real smart if people just see us in the 
      right light. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. <br></td>
