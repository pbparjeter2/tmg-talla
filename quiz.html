              you answer the question, &#8220;Am I an alcoholic?&#8221; Give yourself 
              one point for each &#8220;yes&#8221; answer.</b><br> <br> <b>1.</b> 
              Do you lose time from work due to your drinking?<br> <b>2.</b> Is 
              drinking making your home life unhappy?<br> <b>3.</b> Do you drink 
              because you are shy with other people?<br> <b>4.</b> Is drinking 
              affecting your reputation?<br> <b>5.</b> Have you ever felt remorse 
              after drinking?<br> <b>6.</b> Do you confuse memories of things 
              that have actually happened to you with things that you&#8217;ve 
              seen happen to other people on T.V.?<br> <b>7.</b> Have you gotten 
              into financial dificulties as a result of your drinking?<br> <b>8.</b> 
              Do you turn to lower companions and an inferior environment when 
              drinking?<br> <b>9.</b> Have you ever decided to stop drinking for 
              a week or so, but only lasted for a couple of days?<br> <b>10.</b> 
              Are there periods of time for which you cannot account, no matter 
              how hard you try?<br> <b>11. </b>Do you wish people would mind their 
              own business about your drinking &#8212; stop telling you what to 
              do?<br> <b>12.</b> Has your ambition decreased since drinking?<br> 
              <b>13.</b> Have you had to have an eye-opener upon awakening during 
              the past year?<br> <b>14. </b>Do you envy people who can drink without 
              getting into trouble?<br> <b>15.</b> Do you ever try to get &quot;extra&quot; 
              drinks at a party because you do not get enough?<br> <b>16.</b> 
              Do you sometimes &#8220;skip&#8221; breakfast or lunch so that you&#8217;ll 
              have more money to spend on drinks?<br> <b>17.</b> In arguments, 
              do people quickly concede your point rather than risk having to 
              deal with you when you&#8217;ve gotten overexcited?<br> <b>18. </b>Has 
              the distinction between drinking alone and drinking with others 
              become so badly blurred that you can no longer tell the difference?<br> 
              <b>19.</b> Do you tell yourself you can stop drinking any time you 
              want to, even though you keep getting drunk when you don't mean 
              to?<br> <b>20.</b> Are there no longer times when you really don&#8217;t 
              mean to get drunk?<br> <b>21.</b> Do you love me?<br> <b>22.</b> 
              Do you drink to build up your self-confidence?<br> <b>23.</b> No, 
              really: do you love me?<br> <br> <b>Scoring:</b><br> <br> <b>0-3:</b> 
              Risk <b>low</b>. Even people with no risk of alcoholism sometimes 
              encounter alcohol-related difficulties.<br> <br> <b>4-10:</b> Risk 
              <b>moderate</b>. Alcohol has probably gotten you into more trouble 
              than you&#8217;d like. The possibility that this trend will continue 
              is <i>high</i> unless action is taken soon.<br> <br> <b>11-20:</b> 
              Risk <b>high</b>. Even you are no longer persuaded by the explanations 
              you give for your drinking. Seek help from someplace other than 
              the place where you usually go when you need help.<br> <br> <b>21-23:</b> 
              Risk <b>null</b>. You have ascended the high mountain and are now 
              beyond the kenning of normal men. Any advice we might offer you 
              would be wholly redundant.<br> <br></td>
