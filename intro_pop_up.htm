	  <div align="left"><b>Tallahassee</b> is an album by the Mountain 
                Goats. Its fourteen songs<br>
                document the decay and eventual collapse of a house in the city 
                of<br>
                Tallahassee, Florida, as well as the concurrent decay &amp; collapse 
                of the<br>
                two people who lived inside of it. At the time when their occupation 
                of<br>
                the house began, these two had been married for several years. 
                Their<br>
                dedication to the unsavory and often destructive love they'd cultivated<br>
                was matched only by their zeal for strong drink. As their marriage 
                began<br>
                to come apart at the hinges, they came to think of their house 
                as a sort<br>
                of training ground for self-immolation. Naturally there can be 
                no<br>
                training for this sort of thing: only practice. The rooms on this 
                site,<br>
                whose details were cobbled together from the terrible mess they 
                left at<br>
                the site of their love's last great flaring-up, contain areas 
                for<br>
                further investigation which can be viewed by clicking on any item 
                that<br>
                illuminates itself when you scroll over it with your mouse. In 
                an irony<br>
                worthy of our electronic age, this is perhaps the only illumination 
                ever<br>
                to take place within the walls of this house. Feel free to explore 
                every<br>
                corner of every room, but in feeling such freedom, do spare a 
                thought<br>
                for our heroes, who were only able to feel free when they'd traded 
                in<br>
                their freedom for a couple of vodka gimlets. Be happy. Sing loudly. 
                Take<br>
                care. </div>
