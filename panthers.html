      Power to the people. In 1992, toward the end of a century marked by an increasingly 
      cunning ruling class and a generally passive if occasionally agitated proletariat, 
      capitalist robber-baron H. Wayne Huizenga tightened his stranglehold around 
      the collective neck of the working masses by increasing his holdings to 
      include a National Hockey League expansion franchise. In a cruel stroke 
      of imperialist arrogance, Huizenga named his team the &#8220;Florida Panthers.&#8221; 
      The team&#8217;s namesake, both native and unique to the state after which 
      it was named, had been living at the margins of viability for the better 
      part of a century; hunted to near-extinction in post-Civil War times by 
      innumerable incoming opportunist carpetbaggers (possible role-models for 
      counting-house Huizenga and his ilk), it now took shelter in hidden places 
      and supped on such scraps as it could find, biding its time. Its suitability 
      as an emblem of the Struggle is clear.<br>
      <br>
      The Panthers&#8217; first season of play began on 6 October, 1993, in Chicago, 
      Illinois, traditionally a stronghold of Big Labor, although decades of compromise 
      with upper management and corruption at the higher levels of leadership 
      had made the once-proud city a shell of its formerly progressive self. The 
      overall weakness of the American labor movement was never more evident than 
      in the performance of the Chicago Blackhawks that evening, who could muster 
      no better than a 4 - 4 tie against a team that had never even taken the 
      ice before in regulation play. The Panthers, meanwhile, led by working class 
      hero Rob Niedermeyer and defended by young labor&#8217;s bright hope John 
      Vanbiesbrouck, acquitted themselves quite nimbly for a team whose players 
      earned a mere fraction of their nightly earning power, yet whose income 
      for the first year alone would provide its owners with enough Cristal and 
      beachfront properties to last well into the next millennium.<br>
      <br>
      &#8220;Respect was uppermost on my mind when I came to Miami,&#8221; said 
      Vanbiesbrouck, recalling his early days with the Florida Panthers. &#8220;The 
      new group of us were united in wanting to prove to the rest of the league 
      -- and one another -- that we could play at a competitive level with the 
      rest even though we were a new, expansion team.&#8221; It&#8217;s not hard 
      to decode Vanbiesbrouck&#8217;s remarks: terms like &#8220;respect&#8221; 
      and &#8220;united&#8221; and the Beezer&#8217;s characterization of his 
      team as &#8220;new&#8221; and &#8220;expansion&#8221; are veiled references 
      to the covertly revolutionary nature of his organization. <br>
      <br>
      In their first season the Panthers would register thirty-three victories 
      and thirty-four losses, with some seventeen tie games in overtime rounding 
      out their eighty-four game season. It was an auspicious beginning, and the 
      message traveled along the grapevine that the time was short for the enemies 
      of the people in southern Florida. Disappointingly, the plans of the Florida 
      Panthers to lead a general uprising against the market economy and its crippling 
      carrot-stick techniques would never materialize, and their brave beginnings, 
      shrouded in secrecy and unknown by all save the most hidden layers of labor 
      resistance, would be lost to history.<br>
      <br>
      Yet there remains the hope that the Florida Panthers, once a sleeping cell 
      of strength and struggle, will rise from their shackles of luxuriant contracts 
      and idle wealth and make good on the possibility they once seemed to exude. 
      And while to date the team&#8217;s most revolutionary act has been to make 
      its owners and shareholders embarassingly rich &#8212; an act which admittedly 
      seems more sympathetic to the concerns of the bourgeoisie than to the historical 
      struggle of the people for self-determination &#8212; in the hearts and 
      minds of the masses, from the telemarketing offices of Miami to the tracklit 
      dance floors of Orlando, the dream remains: of a hockey team that would 
      liberate the working man from his capitalist prison, demonstrating through 
      innovative use of the three-on-three forecheck that the means of production 
      rests with those who wield the implements of labor.<br>
      <br>
      Long live the revolutionary struggle of the people! <i>Long live the Florida 
      Panthers</i>!<br>
